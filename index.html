                <h1>Food for a family</h1>
                <p>
                    WFP distributes food in areas where it is scarce. In places where food is available but unaffordable, we give vulnerable people cash or vouchers to buy nutritious ingredients. These cash transfers give people more choice, protect them from financial exploitation, and support the local economy.

                    Give a portion of allowance every week to the poor & needy person or cause support to them. If in case you have less allowance, then you can save some amount of money that you spend on eating at work or school. You can give the saved money to any Sadaqa or Zakat committee of the mosque or any poor person in your neighborhood.

                <h1>Education for a child</h1>
                <p>
                    Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to employment and earning potential later in life. They are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to participate in decisions that affect them  threatening their ability to shape a better future for themselves and their societies
